# The Image Hosting repository for UserPFP
Here the Images used in UserPFP will be stored.

# How to use this repository

A1) If you want to upload an Avatar, you go to the Avatars folder

A2) Here you click whichever folder corresponds to the first digit of the UserID

A3) You rename the file to {ID}.gif or {ID}.png

A4) Now you check if the file already exists, if it does, in the next step, you replace the old file with the new one.

A5) You upload the file into the folder it is supposed to.

A6) The link to this file is "https://coolesding.github.io/hosting/Avatars/{FolderNumber}/{ID}.{FileType}"


# Example

I want to upload a GIF file for the user ID "406084422308331522".

A1) I navigate to the "Avatars" Folder.

A2) Because my ID starts with 4, I open the Folder called "4".

A3) I rename the GIF file I have stored on my computer to "406084422308331522.gif"

A4) Since the File already exists, I keep in mind to replace the old one.

A5) I press the upload button in the "4" Folder and upload my "406084422308331522.gif" file, I make sure that the old one gets replaced.

A6) Wherever I want to use the link, I paste in "https://coolesding.github.io/hosting/Avatars/" and change the link accordingly, which ends up as "https://coolesding.github.io/hosting/Avatars/4/406084422308331522.gif". I check if the link works by pasting it into my browser, and it does, so I know it will work in my application as well (If that isn't broken itself :P)


If you want to upload a badge, use the "Badges" Folder instead.

This Folder doesn't need the extra Number Folder, so you can omit that from the link.

"https://coolesding.github.io/hosting/Badges/{ID}.{FileType}" is the way to format your link after uploading.

In my example, this link would look like this: "https://coolesding.github.io/hosting/Badges/406084422308331522.gif

Thank you for reading.
